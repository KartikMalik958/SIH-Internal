 Our project is designed to streamline the diagnosis of minor medical conditions by leveraging advanced technology with a strong focus on accuracy and user experience. Users enter their personal details, including name, email, gender, age, medical history, past surgeries, and current symptoms, through a web interface built with HTML and CSS. This data is then processed by a machine learning clustering model that boasts an accuracy rate of over 95%, predicting the potential disease the patient may have. The predicted disease is further analyzed by an AI/ML model leveraging Gemini API, which provides personalized lifestyle recommendations aimed at enhancing the patient's overall well-being. A comprehensive report, including the patient's personal information, the predicted diagnosis, and the suggested lifestyle changes, is generated using an integrated Overleaf and Google Collab system and downloaded automatically.
